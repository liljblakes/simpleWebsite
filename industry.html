      <h2>Career of Interest</h2>
      <p>
        A career I’m interested in within financial services is a <strong>Financial Analyst / Investment Analyst</strong>.
        This role involves evaluating companies, analyzing financial statements, building models, and making
        recommendations that help clients or firms make better investing decisions.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Ethical Issue That Could Arise</h2>
      <p>
        One ethical issue in this industry is <strong>conflicts of interest</strong>. For example, an analyst could feel pressure
        to recommend an investment that benefits the firm (or personal relationships) instead of making the most honest,
        evidence-based recommendation for the client.

      <h2>How My Personal Values Shape My Response</h2>
      <p>
        My personal values guide how I would respond to ethical pressure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> I would be truthful and transparent, and I would not recommend something I don’t genuinely believe in.</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> I would follow policies and do the work the right way (documented research, proper process), even if it’s slower.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth:</strong> I would seek feedback, mentorship, and training to handle ethical gray areas correctly and keep improving.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect:</strong> I would prioritize client trust and long-term relationships over short-term wins.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cybersecurity Issues in This Industry/Career</h2>
      <p>
        Financial services is a major target for cyberattacks because attackers can steal money or valuable identity data.

        <li><strong>Phishing & social engineering</strong> that steals employee or customer credentials</li>
        <li><strong>Account takeover</strong> using leaked passwords</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware</strong> that locks systems and disrupts operations</li>
        <li><strong>Data breaches</strong> exposing sensitive customer information (identity and financial data)</li>
        <li><strong>Fraudulent transactions</strong> (unauthorized transfers or payment manipulation)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices in Financial Services</h2>
      <p>
        Best practices that help protect systems, customers, and money include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> reduces risk from stolen passwords</li>
        <li><strong>Least privilege access:</strong> employees only get the access they need</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> protects data in transit and at rest</li>
        <li><strong>Patching & updates:</strong> fixes known vulnerabilities quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring & logging:</strong> detects suspicious logins and unusual transactions</li>
        <li><strong>Security training:</strong> helps employees recognize phishing and scams</li>
        <li><strong>Incident response plan:</strong> a step-by-step plan to contain and recover from attacks</li>
        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> reduces impact if ransomware hits critical systems</li>
